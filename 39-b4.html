            <h2>What is a Clone?</h2>
            <p>A <span class="key-term">clone</span> is a living thing that is an exact genetic copy of another organism. This means they have the same DNA.</p>
            <p>Cloning can happen naturally through asexual reproduction (e.g., bacteria dividing), or it can be done artificially in a lab.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Cloning in Plants</h2>
            <p>Plants are relatively easy to clone. Two common methods used in horticulture and biology are:</p>
            <h3>1. Taking Cuttings</h3>
            <p>Gardeners often take a small part of a plant (a cutting) and plant it in damp soil or rooting powder, which contains hormones to encourage root growth. This produces a new plant that is genetically identical to the parent plant.</p>
            <h3>2. Tissue Culture (Micropropagation)</h3>
            <p>This method is used to produce many identical plants quickly, often for commercial purposes or to preserve rare species. It involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Obtaining very small pieces of plant tissue, called <span class="key-term">explants</span>.</li>
                <li>Growing the explants in a sterile agar jelly containing nutrients and plant hormones.</li>
                <li>The explants grow into small plantlets, which can then be transferred to potting trays to grow into full plants, all clones of the original parent.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Cloning in Animals</h2>
            <p>Animal cloning is more complex and involves different techniques:</p>
            <h3>1. Embryo Transplants</h3>
            <p>This method produces several identical offspring from desirable parent animals (e.g., high-quality livestock). The steps are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Egg and sperm cells from high-quality parents are used for artificial fertilisation.</li>
                <li>The resulting embryo is allowed to develop into a ball of cells.</li>
                <li>The embryo is split into several identical smaller embryos before the cells specialise.</li>
                <li>These cloned embryos are then implanted into different host (surrogate) mothers.</li>
                <li>The resulting offspring are all genetically identical to each other (but share genes from both original parents).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Adult Cell Cloning (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer)</h3>
            <p>This technique creates a clone of an already existing adult animal. Dolly the sheep was the first mammal cloned this way.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The nucleus is removed from an unfertilised egg cell (<span class="key-term">enucleated</span>).</li>
                <li>A nucleus is taken from an adult body cell (e.g., a skin cell) of the animal to be cloned.</li>
                <li>The adult nucleus is inserted into the empty egg cell.</li>
                <li>An electric shock stimulates the egg to divide and form an embryo.</li>
                <li>The embryo is implanted into a surrogate mother to develop until birth.</li>
                <li>The offspring is a clone of the animal that donated the adult body cell nucleus.</li>
            </ol>
