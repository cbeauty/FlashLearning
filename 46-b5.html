            <h2>Introduction to Penicillin</h2>
            <p>
                Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered and has saved millions of lives since its introduction. It is a medicine used to treat **bacterial infections** by killing the infective bacteria inside the body without harming human cells.
            </p>
            <p class="key-point">
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> Antibiotics like penicillin <strong>do not work against viruses</strong>, such as those causing colds or flu, because viruses reproduce inside body cells and lack cell walls.

            <h2>Discovery of Penicillin</h2>
            <h3>Alexander Fleming (1928)</h3>
            <p>
                Penicillin was discovered by accident by Scottish scientist **Alexander Fleming** in 1928. He was studying *Staphylococcus* bacteria in his laboratory when he went on holiday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon his return, he noticed that a blue-green mould (*Penicillium* fungus) had contaminated one of his Petri dishes. The area around the mould was free of bacteria, showing the mould was producing a substance that killed the bacteria. Fleming called this substance penicillin.
            </p>

            <h3>Florey and Chain (1940s)</h3>
            <p>
                Fleming was unable to produce enough pure penicillin for widespread use. It was later developed for mass production during World War II by a research team at the University of Oxford, led by **Howard Florey** and **Ernst Chain**. Their work, funded largely by the American government, led to the mass production and use of penicillin, which dramatically reduced deaths from bacterial infections in wounded soldiers and the general public.

        <section id="mechanism">
            <h2>How Penicillin Works</h2>
            <p>
                Penicillin works by specifically targeting and damaging the **cell walls** of bacteria.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bacterial cells have a strong protective cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which provides rigidity and support.</li>
                <li>Penicillin interferes with the ability of bacteria to build new cell walls, particularly during growth and reproduction.</li>
                <li>Without a properly formed cell wall, the bacterium is vulnerable to outside water pressures, causing it to burst and die (lysis).</li>
                <li>Human cells do not have cell walls, which is why penicillin can kill bacteria inside the body without harming human tissues.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="resistance">
            <h2>Antibiotic Resistance</h2>
            <p>
                The overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to a significant public health issue: **antibiotic resistance**.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bacteria can undergo random genetic mutations. Some mutations can give them a survival advantage, such as the ability to break down penicillin using an enzyme like beta-lactamase (penicillinase). These resistant bacteria survive the antibiotic treatment, reproduce quickly, and pass on the resistance gene, leading to the evolution of resistant strains, or "superbugs" like MRSA.
            </p>
            <h3>How to Prevent Resistance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Doctors should only prescribe antibiotics when necessary and ensure the correct type is used for the specific infection.</li>
                <li>Patients must complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed, even if they feel better, to ensure all bacteria are killed and none are left to develop resistance.</li>
                <li>Antibiotics should never be used for viral infections.</li>
            </ul>
