        <h1>Understanding the 'Molecular Scissors'</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome, GCSE students! In this page, we will explore a fascinating set of biological tools essential for modern genetics. These enzymes are key to manipulating DNA, allowing scientists to cut and paste genetic material with incredible precision. They are naturally found in bacteria where they play a crucial protective role.
        </p>

        <h2>What are They?</h2>
        <p>
            These enzymes are highly specific proteins that act as 'molecular scissors'. Their primary function is to recognise and cut DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. The term <span class="key-term">restriction</span> refers to their natural role in bacteria: they literally *restrict* the growth of foreign viruses (bacteriophages) by chopping up their DNA upon entry.
        </p>

        <div class="analogy">
            <h3>Analogy Time</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine DNA is a very long string of text. A typical enzyme of this type is like a search-and-delete function in a word processor that only deletes the word "GATC" every time it appears. The <span class="key-term">restriction</span> on the function is that it only targets that exact sequence.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Specific Recognition Sites</h2>
        <p>
            Each specific enzyme recognises a unique sequence of bases, often a 4 or 6 base pair long palindrome (sequences that read the same forwards and backwards on opposite strands). When the enzyme finds its specific spot, it binds to the DNA and makes a cut.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> The enzyme scans the DNA strand.</li>
            <li><strong>Binding:</strong> It binds to the specific sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> It breaks the phosphodiester bonds in the DNA backbone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Cuts: Sticky vs. Blunt Ends</h2>
        <p>
            The way these enzymes cut the DNA determines the type of ends produced:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sticky Ends:</strong> These cuts produce staggered ends with short, single-stranded overhangs. These "sticky" ends are very useful because they can easily base-pair (anneal) with other DNA fragments cut with the same enzyme, which is vital for genetic engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blunt Ends:</strong> These cuts go straight across both DNA strands, leaving no overhangs.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Role in Genetic Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            The ability of these enzymes to create compatible "sticky" ends is fundamental to genetic modification. Scientists use them to cut a desired gene from one organism and a plasmid (small circular DNA) from a bacterium. The concept of <span class="key-term">restriction</span> in the lab enables the precise insertion of the gene into the plasmid, creating recombinant DNA. This technology is used to produce insulin, create pest-resistant crops, and more.
