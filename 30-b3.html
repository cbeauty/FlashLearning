            <h2>What is a Mutation?</h2>
            <p>A mutation is a <span class="important">rare, random change</span> in the genetic material (DNA base sequence) of an organism.</p>
            <p>Our DNA is arranged in chromosomes and contains genes, which are sections of DNA that code for specific proteins. Most mutations have no effect on the protein's function, but some can have a significant impact.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Causes of Mutations</h2>
            <p>Mutations occur continuously and can be spontaneous. Their frequency can be increased by environmental factors called mutagens.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ionising radiation:</strong> Gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage DNA.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical mutagens:</strong> Certain chemicals, such as tar found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of mutations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Gene Mutations</h2>
            <p>Gene mutations involve changes to the DNA base sequence. The main types are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Substitution:</strong> One base is randomly swapped for a different base (e.g., A changed to T). This may only change a single amino acid in the protein chain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Insertion:</strong> An extra base is inserted into the sequence. This is often more serious as it changes all subsequent base triplets (codons) and can drastically alter the resulting protein.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deletion:</strong> A base is randomly deleted from the sequence. Like insertion, this changes the grouping of all subsequent base triplets and has a large knock-on effect.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Effects of Mutations</h2>
            <p>Most mutations have little to no effect on the phenotype (physical characteristics). However, some can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Change protein function:</strong> If a mutation changes the shape of a protein, like an enzyme's active site, it may no longer work properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be beneficial:</strong> Very rarely, a mutation might produce a new phenotype that gives an organism a survival advantage, which is key to natural selection and evolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be harmful:</strong> Some mutations cause genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anaemia, where altered haemoglobin causes red blood cells to become stiff and sickle-shaped.
                </li>
            </ul>
