        <h1>GCSE Biology: Active Transport</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this guide on active transport, a vital process for all living cells!</p>

        <h2>What is Active Transport?</h2>
        <p>Active transport is the movement of dissolved molecules into or out of a cell through the cell membrane, from a region of **lower concentration** to a region of **higher concentration**.</p>
        <div class="key-points">
            <strong>Key Points:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>It moves substances <strong>against</strong> the concentration gradient (uphill).</li>
                <li>It <strong>requires energy</strong>, which is released during **respiration** (in the form of ATP).</li>
                <li>It uses specialised **carrier proteins** (also known as 'pumps') embedded in the cell membrane.</li>
                <li>This process is the opposite of diffusion and osmosis, which are passive processes and do not require energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
        <p>Carrier proteins in the cell membrane use energy from respiration to change shape and move specific molecules across the membrane, against the natural flow of the concentration gradient.</p>

        <h2>Examples in Living Organisms</h2>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>1. Mineral Ion Uptake in Plant Root Hair Cells</h3>
            <p>Plants need mineral ions (like magnesium for chlorophyll, and nitrates for protein synthesis) for healthy growth. The concentration of these ions in the soil is often much lower than inside the root hair cells.</p>
            <p>Therefore, active transport is used to pump these ions into the roots against the concentration gradient. Root hair cells have many mitochondria to provide the necessary energy for this process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>2. Glucose Absorption in the Human Gut</h3>
            <p>After a meal, glucose can initially be absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine by diffusion. However, the body needs to absorb as much glucose as possible.</p>
            <p>Active transport allows glucose to be absorbed into the blood even when the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream is higher than in the gut (lumen). The cells lining the small intestine are rich in mitochondria to power this process, ensuring no vital glucose is lost in waste.</p>
