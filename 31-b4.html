            <h2>The Theory of Natural Selection</h2>
            <p>
                The theory of evolution by natural selection was independently developed by two British naturalists: **Charles Darwin** and **Alfred Russel Wallace**. Darwin published his extensive evidence and ideas in his influential book *On the Origin of Species* in 1859, which is why he is most commonly associated with the theory today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Natural selection explains how species change over time to become better adapted to their environment. This process is often summarised as "survival of the fittest".
            </p>

            <h2>Key Principles for GCSE Students</h2>
            <p>
                The theory of natural selection is based on several key observations and principles:
            </p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>1. Variation:</strong> Individuals within a species show a wide range of variation in their characteristics (phenotypes) due to differences in their genes.
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>2. Overproduction:</strong> Organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support, leading to competition for limited resources (a 'struggle for existence').
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>3. Survival Advantage:</strong> Individuals with characteristics best suited to their environment are more likely to survive this struggle and reproduce successfully.
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>4. Inheritance:</strong> The advantageous characteristics (alleles) are passed on to the next generation.
            </div>

            <p>
                Over many generations, the advantageous characteristics become more common in the population, and the species as a whole becomes better adapted to its environment. This leads to evolution.
            </p>

            <h2>Who Was Charles Darwin?</h2>
            <p>
                Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was an English naturalist who embarked on a five-year voyage around the world on the ship HMS *Beagle*. During this voyage, particularly his time in the Galápagos Islands, he made crucial observations of plants and animals, such as the different beak shapes of finches, which helped him formulate his ideas.
            </p>

            <h2>Example: Peppered Moths</h2>
            <p>
                A classic example of natural selection in action is the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution.
                Before the revolution, most moths were light-coloured and well-camouflaged against light trees. Soot from factories darkened the trees, making the light moths easy for predators to spot. Darker, mutated moths now had the survival advantage, and their numbers increased over generations, a process called directional selection.
