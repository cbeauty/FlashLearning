            <h2>The Body's Transport Network</h2>
            <p>
                The human body is an incredible machine, and central to its operation is the <strong>circulatory</strong> system. This vital network of blood vessels, blood, and the heart ensures that every cell in the body receives the oxygen and nutrients it needs to survive. Without a functioning <strong>circulatory</strong> system, life would not be possible.
            </p>

            <h2>The Central Pump</h2>
            <p>
                The heart is a powerful muscular organ, crucial for maintaining the <strong>circulatory</strong> flow. It pumps blood around the body in a continuous, double loop. One loop goes to the lungs to pick up oxygen, and the other loop delivers this oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. This efficient double <strong>circulatory</strong> system is a key topic for GCSE biology students.
            </p>

            <h2>Vessels and Their Roles</h2>
            <p>
                The blood travels through three main types of vessels. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, typically high in oxygen. Veins carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels that allow for the exchange of substances between the blood and body tissues. Understanding these differences is fundamental to grasping how the <strong>circulatory</strong> process works.
            </p>

            <h2>What Makes Up the Flow?</h2>
            <p>
                Blood itself is a complex fluid. It is made of several components: red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cells (part of the immune system), platelets (for clotting), and plasma (the liquid medium). All these components work in harmony within the <strong>circulatory</strong> system to maintain health and homeostasis.
