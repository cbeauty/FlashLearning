        <h2>What are Vaccines and How Do They Work?</h2>
        <p>Vaccination is a crucial topic in the GCSE Biology curriculum, explaining how our immune system can be trained to fight specific diseases.</p>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <h3>The Science Behind the Jab</h3>
            <p>Vaccines work by introducing small quantities of **dead or inactive forms of a pathogen** (or just their antigens) into the body. These harmless versions still contain specific <strong>antigens</strong> that trigger an immune response without causing the actual disease.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            <h3>The Immune Response</h3>
            <p>Once introduced, white blood cells in your body are stimulated to produce <strong>antibodies</strong> that are specific to those antigens. Critically, this process also results in the formation of <strong>memory cells</strong>, which remain in the bloodstream for a long time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            <h3>Future Protection (Secondary Response)</h3>
            <p>If the same, live pathogen re-enters the body in the future, the memory cells quickly recognise it and produce the correct antibodies rapidly and in large amounts. This swift and strong secondary immune response prevents the infection from taking hold, meaning you don't get sick.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Importance of Mass Vaccination: Herd Immunity</h2>
        <p>Vaccination not only protects the individual but also helps the entire community. When a large proportion of the population is vaccinated, it is very difficult for a disease to spread. This concept is known as **herd immunity**.</p>
        <p>Herd immunity protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants or people with certain medical conditions, by breaking the chain of infection. Diseases like smallpox have been eradicated globally due to successful mass vaccination campaigns.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Terms to Remember</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pathogen:</strong> A microorganism that causes disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Antigen:</strong> A protein on the surface of a pathogen that triggers an immune response.</li>
            <li><strong>Antibody:</strong> A protein produced by white blood cells that targets and destroys specific antigens/pathogens.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Cells:</strong> Specialised white blood cells that remember specific pathogens and allow for a quick response upon second exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Herd Immunity:</strong> When enough people are immune to a disease to stop it from spreading through the population.</li>
        </ul>
