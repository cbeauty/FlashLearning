        <h1>Cellular Respiration: Turning Food into Energy</h1>
        <p>Welcome, GCSE students! This page will help you understand how your body, and the bodies of most living organisms, convert glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water to release energy. This process is called <strong>cellular respiration</strong>.</p>

        <h2>What is Cellular Respiration?</h2>
        <p>Cellular respiration is the chemical process that occurs in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. In simple terms, it's how your body gets energy from the food you eat and the air you breathe.</p>

        <h2>The Key Players: Glucose and Oxygen</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>):</strong> This is a simple sugar, a type of carbohydrate, that comes from the food you eat. It's your body's primary fuel source.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>):</strong> This gas is taken in when you breathe. It's essential for efficient energy release during aerobic respiration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Products: Carbon Dioxide, Water, and Energy!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>):</strong> A waste product that you breathe out.</li>
            <li><strong>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O):</strong> Another waste product, some of which is used by the body and some is excreted.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy (ATP):</strong> This is the most important product! ATP is the energy currency of the cell, used to power all life processes like movement, growth, and maintaining body temperature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Chemical Equation</h2>
        <p>The overall balanced chemical equation for aerobic cellular respiration is:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (Glucose) + 6O<sub>2</sub> (Oxygen) &rarr; 6CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide) + 6H<sub>2</sub>O (Water) + Energy (ATP)
        </div>
        <p>This equation shows that one molecule of glucose reacts with six molecules of oxygen to produce six molecules of carbon dioxide, six molecules of water, and a significant amount of energy in the form of ATP.</p>

        <h2>Where Does it Happen?</h2>
        <p>While some initial steps occur in the cytoplasm, the main stages of aerobic cellular respiration, where most of the energy is released, take place in the <strong>mitochondria</strong> – often called the "powerhouses of the cell."</p>

        <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
        <p>Cellular respiration is vital for all living organisms. Without it, cells wouldn't have the energy to perform their functions, and life as we know it would not be possible.</p>
