        <h2>What are Chromosomes?</h2>
        <p>Chromosomes are thread-like structures found inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (animal and plant cells). They carry the genetic information of an organism.</p>
        <p>They are made of a very long molecule of <span class="key-term">DNA</span> (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is tightly coiled and condensed with proteins.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**DNA, Genes, and Chromosomes:** A chromosome is a package of DNA. A <span class="key-term">gene</span> is a short section of DNA that codes for a specific protein, which determines our characteristics.</li>
            <li>**Human Chromosomes:** Ordinary human body cells contain <span class="key-term">46 chromosomes</span>, arranged in <span class="key-term">23 pairs</span>. You inherit one chromosome from each pair from your mother and the other from your father.</li>
            <li>**Diploid vs. Haploid:**
                <ul>
                    <li>Most body cells are <span class="key-term">diploid</span> (2n), meaning they have the full 23 pairs.</li>
                    <li>Sex cells (<span class="key-term">gametes</span> - sperm and egg cells) are <span class="key-term">haploid</span> (n), meaning they have only a single set of 23 unpaired chromosomes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**The 'X' Shape:** Chromosomes are usually long, thin strands and not visible. They only become visible under a microscope when a cell is about to divide, at which point the DNA has replicated, forming the characteristic 'X' shape, where two identical copies (sister chromatids) are joined at the centromere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chromosomes and Cell Division</h2>
        <p>Chromosomes play a crucial role in cell division, ensuring the genetic information is passed on correctly to new cells.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Mitosis:** This process produces two genetically identical diploid daughter cells. It is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. Before mitosis, each chromosome is copied.</li>
            <li>**Meiosis:** This process occurs in reproductive organs to form gametes. The cell divides twice to produce four unique haploid gamete cells. This is important for genetic variation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sex Determination</h2>
        <p>The 23rd pair of chromosomes are the sex chromosomes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Females:** Have two X chromosomes (XX).</li>
            <li>**Males:** Have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).</li>
            <li>**Inheritance:** All egg cells contain an X chromosome. Sperm cells contain either an X or a Y chromosome, determining the sex of the offspring at fertilisation.</li>
        </ul>
