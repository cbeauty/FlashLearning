            <h2>What it Does</h2>
            <p>
                Nerve cells, or neurones, transmit electrical signals (impulses) throughout your body very quickly. To help these signals travel even faster and more efficiently, many nerve fibres have a special coating. This crucial fatty layer is called the <span class="key-term">myelin sheath</span>. Its primary job is to provide insulation around the axon, the long part of the neurone that carries the impulse away from the cell body.

            <h2>The Speed of Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Think of the myelin sheath like the plastic coating around an electrical wire. Without it, the electrical signal would slow down and potentially 'leak' out. The presence of the myelin sheath forces the impulse to jump between tiny gaps in the coating, a process called saltatory conduction. This mechanism dramatically increases the speed at which nerve impulses can be transmitted, which is vital for quick reflexes and overall efficient body function.

            <h2>Understanding Issues</h2>
            <p>
                In some diseases, this vital layer can become damaged or destroyed. When the myelin sheath breaks down, the transmission of nerve impulses slows down or stops altogether, leading to various neurological symptoms. Understanding the structure and function of the myelin sheath is therefore key to understanding how our nervous system communicates so effectively.
