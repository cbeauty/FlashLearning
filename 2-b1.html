            <h2>Moving Water in and out of Cells</h2>
            <p>
                Living organisms are mostly made of water. This water needs to move into and out of cells for essential life processes. A key type of cell transport involves the movement of solvent molecules, usually water, across a special barrier. This process, known as osmosis, is vital for plant support and kidney function in animals.

                <h3>The Basics of Diffusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Before diving into the specifics of water movement, it's helpful to remember that particles are always moving randomly. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This process requires no energy and is how things like oxygen enter cells and carbon dioxide leaves them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>How Water Moves</h2>
            <p>
                The movement of water across a partially permeable membrane (a membrane that only lets certain molecules pass through) is a specific type of diffusion. In osmosis, water molecules move from a region where they are at a higher concentration (a dilute solution) to a region where they are at a lower concentration (a concentrated solution).
            </p>
            <p>
                This concept is crucial for understanding what happens to plant and animal cells when placed in different solutions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pure Water/Dilute Solution:</strong> Water enters the cell by osmosis, causing animal cells to burst (lyse) and plant cells to become firm (turgid).</li>
                <li><strong>Concentrated Solution:</strong> Water leaves the cell by osmosis, causing animal cells to shrink (crenate) and plant cell membranes to pull away from the cell wall (plasmolysis).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Essential Practical Work</h2>
            <p>
                A common required practical involves testing the effect of different sugar or salt solutions on plant tissue, such as potato cylinders. By measuring changes in mass and length, students can determine the water potential of the plant tissue. This experiment demonstrates the principles of osmosis in a controlled setting.
