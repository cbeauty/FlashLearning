            <h2>The Structure of the Blueprint</h2>
            <p>
                Our bodies, and all living things, are made of cells that contain a complex set of instructions. These instructions are stored in the DNA molecule, which looks like a twisted ladder. For life to work, this massive molecule needs to be handled with extreme care, especially when cells divide.
            </p>

            <h2>Copying the Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                When a cell needs to divide, it must first make a complete copy of its DNA. This process is called replication. The double helix unwinds, and new strands are built alongside the old ones. This process isn't perfect, and the new strands are made in small pieces on one side. This is where a very important enzyme comes in.
            </p>

            <h2>Joining the Pieces Together</h2>
            <p>
                To create a continuous, healthy new strand of DNA, the small fragments need to be sealed. This job is handled by an enzyme often described as a molecular 'glue' or 'stapler'. This critical molecule is known as <span class="key-term">DNA ligase</span>. Its function is to create a strong phosphodiester bond between the fragments, effectively mending the backbone of the DNA.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Point:</strong> Without the action of DNA ligase, the DNA strands would remain fragmented, which would be disastrous for the cell and the organism. It ensures the integrity and stability of the genetic code.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Applications in Biology</h2>
            <p>
                The role of DNA ligase isn't just in living cells; it's a vital tool in genetic engineering and biotechnology. Scientists use this enzyme to insert new genes into different organisms, for example, making bacteria produce useful medicines like insulin. The enzyme acts as the essential sealant, allowing scientists to piece together DNA from different sources to create recombinant DNA.
