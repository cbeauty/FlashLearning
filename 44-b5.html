            <h2>The Role of Specific Medicines</h2>
            <p>
                When a doctor confirms a bacterial infection, they might prescribe certain types of medication. These are powerful tools designed to either kill the bacteria outright or slow their growth so the body's immune system can take over. These substances, commonly referred to as antibiotics, are a cornerstone of modern medicine and have saved countless lives since their discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is crucial to understand that these medicines are only effective against bacteria. They cannot treat illnesses caused by viruses, such as the common cold or flu. Taking antibiotics for a viral infection is not only useless but can also be harmful in the long run.
            </p>

            <h3>How They Work</h3>
            <p>
                Different types of these medications work in various ways. Some, like penicillin, target the cell walls of bacteria, causing them to burst. Others interfere with the bacteria's ability to make proteins or copy their genetic material, which stops them from growing and reproducing. This targeted action is what makes them so effective against bacterial invaders.
            </p>

                <h3>Important Study Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They work by killing bacteria or preventing their reproduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> They are ineffective against viruses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> Misusing these substances can lead to resistant strains of bacteria, a major global health concern.</li>
                    <li><strong>Completion:</strong> Always finish the full course as prescribed by a medical professional, even if you start to feel better. This ensures all the harmful bacteria are eliminated.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Dealing with Misuse and Resistance</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges facing healthcare today is the rise of resistant bacteria. When antibiotics are overused or not used correctly, some bacteria can survive the treatment. These survivors then multiply, creating a population that is no longer affected by those specific medications. This is known as resistance, and it makes treating future infections much harder.
            </p>
            <p>
                For students studying GCSE biology, understanding this process is vital. It highlights the importance of responsible use of these powerful medicines in preserving their effectiveness for future generations.
