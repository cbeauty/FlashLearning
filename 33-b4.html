            <h2>1. What is Evolution?</h2>
            <p>Evolution is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. The most widely accepted explanation is the theory of natural selection, first proposed by Charles Darwin.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="nat-selection">
            <h2>2. Natural Selection</h2>
            <p>This is the central mechanism of evolution. It can be broken down into key steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>**Variation:** Individuals within a species show a wide range of variation in their characteristics (due to mutations).</li>
                <li>**Competition:** Individuals must compete for resources like food, water, and shelter.</li>
                <li>**Survival of the Fittest:** Individuals with characteristics best suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.</li>
                <li>**Inheritance:** The successful genes are passed on to the next generation. Over time, the advantageous characteristics become more common in the population.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="adaptation">
            <h2>3. Adaptation & Competition</h2>
            <p>An **adaptation** is a feature that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its specific habitat. This can be a structural, functional, or behavioural feature.</p>
            <p>Examples of adaptations could include a bird's beak shape for specific food sources, or camouflage to avoid predators.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="evidence">
            <h2>4. Evidence for Evolution</h2>
            <p>We know evolution happens because of several key pieces of evidence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Fossils:** The fossil record shows how different species have changed over geological time.</li>
                <li>**Homologous Structures:** Similar bone structures in different species (like a human arm and a whale flipper) suggest a common ancestor.</li>
                <li>**DNA Comparison:** Genetic sequencing allows us to see how closely related different species are.</li>
            </ul>
