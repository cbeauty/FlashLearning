            <h2>Understanding Sex Linkage</h2>
            <p>In humans, we have 23 pairs of chromosomes. 22 pairs are **autosomes** (non-sex chromosomes), and one pair are the **sex chromosomes** (X and Y).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Females</strong> have two X chromosomes (<strong>XX</strong>).</li>
                <li><strong>Males</strong> have one X and one Y chromosome (<strong>XY</strong>).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sex-linked disorders are caused by faulty alleles located on these sex chromosomes, most commonly the X chromosome. The Y chromosome is much smaller and carries fewer genes.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="inheritance-patterns">
            <h2>Inheritance Patterns</h2>
            <p>The unique inheritance pattern means males are more likely to suffer from X-linked recessive disorders because they only have one X chromosome. Females have a "backup" X, which usually masks the effect of a recessive allele, making them a **carrier**.</p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Key Facts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Males (XY): If they inherit a faulty X chromosome, they will have the disorder.</li>
                    <li>Females (XX): Need two faulty X chromosomes to express the disorder. If they inherit one, they are a carrier and are usually unaffected.</li>
                    <li>Males inherit their X chromosome from their mother and their Y from their father.</li>
                    <li>Females inherit one X from each parent.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="examples">
            <h2>Common Examples</h2>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>Red-Green Colour Blindness</h3>
                <p>This is a classic example of an X-linked recessive disorder.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sufferers find it difficult to distinguish between red and green shades.</li>
                    <li>It affects about 8% of men but only about 1% of women.</li>
                    <li>Genotype notation uses the X and Y chromosomes with superscript alleles (e.g., X<sup>B</sup> for normal vision, X<sup>b</sup> for colour blindness). A carrier female is X<sup>B</sup>X<sup>b</sup>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>Haemophilia</h3>
                <p>Haemophilia is another X-linked recessive disorder where the blood does not clot properly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minor injuries can cause continuous bleeding due to the lack of necessary clotting factors.</li>
                    <li>Historically known for affecting European royal families.</li>
                    <li>It primarily affects males.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <section id="punnett-squares">
            <h2>Punnett Squares (Genetic Diagrams)</h2>
            <p>You need to be able to use Punnett squares to predict inheritance probabilities. Remember to include the sex chromosomes (X and Y) with the alleles as superscripts.</p>
            <!-- A simple text representation of a Punnett square -->
            <p><strong>Example Cross:</strong> A carrier female (X<sup>B</sup>X<sup>b</sup>) and an unaffected male (X<sup>B</sup>Y)</p>
            <p>Possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes:</p>
            <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>X&supB; (Male gamete)</th>
                        <th>Y (Male gamete)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>X&supB; (Female gamete)</th>
                        <td>X&supB;X&supB; (Normal female)</td>
                        <td>X&supB;Y (Normal male)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>X&supb; (Female gamete)</th>
                        <td>X&supB;X&supb; (Carrier female)</td>
                        <td>X&supb;Y (Affected male)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>In this cross, there is a 25% chance of a male offspring having colour blindness.</p>
