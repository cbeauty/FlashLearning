        <h2>What are Stem Cells?</h2>
        <p>A stem cell is an <strong>undifferentiated cell</strong> of an organism that has the ability to divide to form many more cells of the same type. From these, other cells can arise through the process of <strong>differentiation</strong> (specialisation).</p>
        <p>In simple terms, they are "blank" cells that can become specialised cells like muscle cells, nerve cells, or blood cells.</p>

        <h2>Types of Stem Cells</h2>

        <div class="stem-cell-type">
            <h3>Embryonic Stem Cells (Animals)</h3>
            <p>Found in early embryos, these cells can differentiate into <strong>most different types</strong> of human cells. Scientists can grow them in a lab and encourage them to form new tissues for medical treatment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stem-cell-type">
            <h3>Adult Stem Cells (Animals)</h3>
            <p>Found in limited numbers in certain locations in the body, such as <strong>bone marrow</strong>. They can only differentiate into a <strong>limited range</strong> of cell types, primarily blood cells.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stem-cell-type">
            <h3>Meristem Cells (Plants)</h3>
            <p>Plants have stem cells in regions called <strong>meristems</strong> (found in the tips of shoots and roots). These cells can differentiate into <strong>any type</strong> of plant cell throughout the life of the plant.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Uses of Stem Cells in Medicine</h2>
        <p>Stem cell technology offers potential treatments for various diseases and injuries. They could be used to replace damaged cells or grow new organs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Treating conditions such as <strong>diabetes</strong> and <strong>paralysis</strong>.</li>
            <li>In <strong>therapeutic cloning</strong>, an embryo is produced with the same genes as the patient, so the stem cells from it would not be rejected by the patient's body.</li>
            <li>Plant meristems can be used to quickly and economically clone rare species or disease-resistant crops.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ethical and Social Issues</h2>
        <div class="ethics">
            <p>The use of stem cells, especially embryonic stem cells, involves important ethical considerations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Potential risks, such as the transfer of <strong>viral infections</strong>.</li>
                <li>Some people have strong <strong>ethical or religious objections</strong> to the use of embryos in medical research, as they believe life begins at conception.</li>
                <li>Therapeutic cloning raises questions about the creation and destruction of embryos for treatment purposes.</li>
            </ul>
