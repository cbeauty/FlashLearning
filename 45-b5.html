            <h2>What are Non-Communicable Diseases?</h2>
            <p>
                Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are medical conditions or diseases that are <strong>not caused by pathogens</strong> (like bacteria or viruses) and <strong>cannot be passed from person to person</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                They tend to be long-lasting and develop slowly over time. Examples include cardiovascular diseases, most cancers, and Type 2 diabetes.

            <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>
                NCDs are often the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioural factors. A <span class="key-term">risk factor</span> is anything that increases the chance of developing a disease.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Risk Factors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Poor diet (high in sugar/fat/salt), lack of physical exercise, smoking (tobacco use), and excessive alcohol consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Exposure to harmful chemicals (carcinogens) or radiation (like UV light), and air pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Inherited genes can predispose individuals to certain conditions, such as some types of cancer or diabetes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Examples and Effects</h2>
            
            <h3>Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)</h3>
            <p>
                CVDs, such as heart disease and stroke, are the leading cause of NCD deaths globally. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking.
            </p>

            <h3>Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Cancer involves changes in cells that lead to uncontrolled growth and division, forming tumours. Malignant tumours can spread to other parts of the body. Causes include genetic factors, carcinogens in cigarette smoke, and UV radiation.
            </p>

            <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
            <p>
                Often linked to obesity and a poor diet, Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin or the cells stop reacting to insulin properly, leading to high blood glucose levels.

        <section id="impact">
            <h2>Impact on Health and Society</h2>
            <p>
                NCDs can lead to long-term disability, reduced quality of life, and premature death. They also place a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and individuals. Understanding these links helps promote preventative healthcare and public health strategies, like anti-smoking campaigns.
