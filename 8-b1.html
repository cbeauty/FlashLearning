            <h2>The Role in Living Organisms</h2>
            <p>
                In biology, certain protein molecules are crucial for speeding up the rate of chemical reactions without being used up themselves. These biological catalysts are called <span class="key-term">enzymes</span>. They are vital for processes like digestion and respiration.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Structure and Function</h2>
            <p>
                Each enzyme has a specifically shaped area on its surface called the <span class="key-term">active site</span>. This site is complementary to the shape of the molecule it acts upon, known as the <span class="key-term">substrate</span>. This is often explained by the 'lock and key' hypothesis, where only the correct key (substrate) can fit into the specific lock (active site) of the enzymes.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the substrate binds, a reaction occurs, and the products are released. The enzymes are then free to catalyse the next reaction.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Factors Affecting Activity</h2>
            <p>
                The rate at which these proteins function is sensitive to their surroundings. Key factors include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Each enzyme has an optimal temperature. If it gets too hot, the enzyme's active site changes shape permanently, a process called <span class="key-term">denaturation</span>. This means the substrate can no longer fit, and the enzyme stops working.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Just like temperature, there's an optimal pH. Moving outside this range can also cause denaturation. For example, stomach enzymes work best in acidic conditions, while others in the small intestine prefer alkaline conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Substrate Concentration:</strong> Increasing the amount of substrate molecules can increase the reaction rate up to a certain point, after which all active sites are saturated and the rate plateaus.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Importance in Industry</h2>
            <p>
                These biological catalysts are not just important in the body; they are also used in various industrial processes, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breaking down starches into sugars for food production.</li>
                <li>Adding to biological washing powders to help remove stains effectively at lower temperatures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
