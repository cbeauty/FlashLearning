            <h2>The Power Producers</h2>
            <p>
                Every living cell needs energy to function, grow, and divide. The structures responsible for generating almost all of this energy in eukaryotic cells are the <strong>mitochondria</strong>. They are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of the cell. Without functioning mitochondria, cells would not be able to perform the essential process of aerobic respiration efficiently.
            </p>

            <div class="key-facts">
                <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The process that happens here is called aerobic respiration.</li>
                    <li>This process uses glucose and oxygen to create energy.</li>
                    <li>Carbon dioxide and water are the waste products.</li>
                    <li>Cells with high energy demands, like muscle cells, have many mitochondria.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Inside the Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Mitochondria are fascinating organelles because they have a double membrane. The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is highly folded into structures called <strong>cristae</strong>. These folds significantly increase the surface area available for the chemical reactions of aerobic respiration to take place. The central part, enclosed by the inner membrane, is called the <strong>matrix</strong>. The unique structure of mitochondria is perfectly adapted to their function.
            </p>

            <h2>Importance in Biology</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the function of mitochondria is crucial for your GCSE Biology studies. The energy produced (in the form of ATP) powers all metabolic activities in the organism. From thinking with your brain cells to contracting your biceps, it all relies on the efficient operation of mitochondria. They even contain their own small amount of DNA, separate from the cell's main nucleus!
