            <h2>The Basics of Growth and Repair</h2>
            <p>Cell division is a fundamental biological process. In the human body, one specific process is primarily used for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in simple organisms. This process ensures that every new cell is a perfect copy of the original, maintaining the correct number of chromosomes.</p>
            <p>This method results in two identical daughter cells, each genetically the same as the parent cell. Key stages include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, where chromosomes are carefully duplicated and separated. This is how a cut on your skin heals or how an organism grows from a single fertilised egg.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Creating New Life</h2>
            <p>Another, more complex form of division is essential for sexual reproduction. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half, creating specialised sex cells (gametes) like sperm and egg cells. When these two unique cells combine during fertilisation, the correct chromosome number for the offspring is restored.</p>
            <p>This division involves two rounds of separation, resulting in four daughter cells that are genetically different from each other and the parent cell. This genetic variation is crucial for evolution and the diversity of life, involving processes like crossing over that shuffle genetic information.</p>

            <h2>Summary of Key Differences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One process creates body cells (somatic cells) for growth, while the other creates sex cells (gametes) for reproduction.</li>
                <li>The number of daughter cells produced differs: two vs. four.</li>
                <li>The genetic makeup of the resulting cells is a key distinction: identical vs. varied.</li>
                <li>The goal of the former is exact replication; the goal of the latter is genetic diversity.</li>
