        <h2>What is Natural Selection?</h2>
        <p>
            Natural selection is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. It is the key mechanism of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin as "survival of the fittest". This process leads to species becoming more suited, or **adapted**, to their surroundings over many generations.
        </p>

        <h2>The Four Key Principles</h2>
        <div class="key-points">
            <ul>
                <li>**Variation:** Individuals within a species show a wide range of variation in their characteristics (phenotypes) due to differences in their genes (genotypes), which arise from mutations.</li>
                <li>**Overproduction and Competition:** More offspring are produced than can survive, leading to a "struggle for existence" for limited resources like food and shelter.</li>
                <li>**Selection:** Individuals with characteristics that are more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.</li>
                <li>**Inheritance and Time:** The successful individuals pass their advantageous genes to their offspring. Over many generations, the advantageous characteristics become more common in the population, leading to evolution.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Examples in Action</h2>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>Example 1: The Peppered Moths</h3>
            <p>
                A classic example involves peppered moths during the Industrial Revolution. Before pollution, light-coloured moths were camouflaged against light tree bark, while dark moths were easily seen and eaten by birds. As soot covered the trees, the dark moths became camouflaged and the light moths became vulnerable. This led to an increase in the dark moth population and a decrease in the light moth population over time, as the dark moths were more likely to survive and reproduce in the changed environment.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>Example 2: Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria</h3>
            <p>
                Bacteria reproduce very quickly, and random mutations occur frequently. Some mutations can result in a gene that provides resistance to an antibiotic. When exposed to that antibiotic, the non-resistant bacteria die, but the resistant ones survive and reproduce rapidly. This creates a new, resistant strain of bacteria, demonstrating natural selection in action over a very short timescale.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Summary for Exams</h2>
        <p>
            Remember the core idea: nature "selects" the individuals with the best traits for a specific environment. Those individuals survive, breed, and pass on their advantageous genes, causing the species to adapt over time.
