        <h1>GCSE Biology: Understanding the Phenotype</h1>
        <p>Welcome, GCSE students! This page will help you understand the key biological term: <strong>phenotype</strong>.</p>

        <h2>What is the Phenotype?</h2>
        <div class="definition">
            <p>The <strong>phenotype</strong> refers to the <strong>observable characteristics</strong> or traits of an organism. These are the features you can literally see or measure, such as eye colour, height, or even blood type (which can be measured in a lab).</p>
            <p>The word "pheno" comes from the Greek word for "to show" or "to appear", helping you remember that it's all about what is *shown*.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Genotype vs. Phenotype</h2>
        <p>It's important not to confuse phenotype with <strong>genotype</strong>, which is the specific combination of alleles (different versions of a gene) an organism has for a particular trait.</p>
        <p>Think of it this way:</p>
        <ul class="example-list">
            <li><strong>Genotype:</strong> The *genetic code* (e.g., the letters like Bb, BB, or bb).</li>
            <li><strong>Phenotype:</strong> The *result* you can see (e.g., brown eyes or blue eyes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Role of Genes and the Environment</h2>
        <p>A person's phenotype is determined by both their genetic makeup (genotype) and environmental factors.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p><strong>Phenotype = Genotype + Environment</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Examples of Environmental Influence:</h3>
        <ul class="example-list">
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> Your genes determine your potential height, but factors like your childhood diet and overall health (environmental factors) also play a significant role in how tall you actually become.</li>
            <li><strong>Skin Colour:</strong> Genes affect how much melanin you produce, but exposure to the sun causes your skin to darken (a tan), which is an environmental effect on your phenotype.</li>
            <li><strong>Flamingos:</strong> A classic example! Flamingos are naturally white. Their pink colour phenotype comes from pigments in the organisms they eat (their diet).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Phenotype Examples</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of phenotypes in humans and other organisms:</p>
        <ul class="example-list">
            <li>Eye colour (blue, brown, green, etc.)</li>
            <li>Hair colour and type (straight, curly)</li>
            <li>Blood type (A, B, AB, O)</li>
            <li>Ability to roll your tongue</li>
            <li>Presence of a genetic disorder, like cystic fibrosis</li>
            <li>Flower colour in pea plants (purple or white)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Test Your Knowledge!</h2>
        <p>Can you tell the difference between a genotype and a phenotype in these examples? Keep revising these terms for your exams!</p>
