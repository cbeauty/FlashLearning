            <h2>How Messages Travel</h2>
            <p>Our bodies use electrical signals to react to the world around us. These signals (impulses) travel along specialised cells called neurones. But what happens when an impulse needs to jump from one neurone to the next?</p>
            <p>The gap between two neurones is called a <span class="key-term">synapse</span>. The electrical signal can't simply jump across this physical gap. Instead, the body uses special chemical messengers to carry the information.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Chemical Messengers</h2>
            <p>These crucial chemicals are known as neurotransmitters. When an electrical impulse reaches the end of the first neurone, tiny sacs (vesicles) release these chemicals into the synaptic gap.</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <p><em>[Insert Diagram Here: A simplified diagram showing the synapse, with a neurone on each side, vesicles releasing neurotransmitters, and receptors on the receiving neurone.]</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the gap and bind to specific <span class="key-term">receptor</span> sites on the surface of the next neurone. This binding triggers a new electrical impulse in the second neurone, allowing the message to continue its journey.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>After the Message</h2>
            <p>Once the message is passed on, the neurotransmitter is quickly removed from the synapse. This is usually done by being broken down by enzymes or being reabsorbed by the first neurone. This ensures the signal is brief and precise, preventing continuous stimulation of the next neurone.</p>
