            <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
            <p>Diabetes is a serious disease in which the body is unable to effectively control its <span class="key-term">blood glucose</span> (blood sugar) levels, causing them to remain too high. Glucose is vital as it's the main source of energy for all body cells, but high levels in the blood can damage tissues over time.</p>
            <p>The body normally uses the hormone <span class="key-term">insulin</span>, produced by the pancreas, to help glucose move from the blood into the cells. In a person with diabetes, this process doesn't work correctly.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Blood Glucose Regulation (Homeostasis)</h2>
            <p>In a healthy person, blood glucose concentration is regulated within a narrow, healthy range through a process called homeostasis. Key players in this are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pancreas:</strong> Detects changes in blood glucose levels and releases hormones.</li>
                <li><strong>Insulin:</strong> A hormone released when blood glucose is too high. It causes the liver and muscle cells to take up glucose from the blood and convert it into <span class="key-term">glycogen</span> for storage, thus lowering blood glucose.</li>
                <li><strong>Glucagon:</strong> (Briefly mention for context, though often less detailed in GCSE) A hormone released when blood glucose is too low, stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen back into glucose and release it into the blood.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
            <p>There are two main types of diabetes, which differ in their causes and treatments.</p>

            <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cause:</strong> The pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin, often due to the body's own immune system destroying the insulin-producing cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Onset:</strong> Usually develops in childhood or young adulthood.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Requires regular <span class="key-term">insulin injections</span> (often throughout the day) and careful monitoring of diet and physical activity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cause:</strong> The body's cells no longer respond properly to the insulin produced by the pancreas (insulin resistance).</li>
                <li><strong>Onset:</strong> More common in older adults, and there is a strong correlation with <span class="key-term">obesity</span> and lifestyle factors (e.g., unhealthy diet, lack of exercise).</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Often managed through a carbohydrate-controlled diet and regular exercise. Weight loss is also key. Insulin injections may be needed in some cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Common Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
            <p>Early signs and symptoms for both types can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased thirst</li>
                <li>Frequent urination</li>
                <li>Extreme tiredness or weakness</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>Blurred vision</li>
            </ul>
